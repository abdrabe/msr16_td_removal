 *          Exhaustive testing has not been done.  Please consider it beta
 *          quality.  Feedback is appreciated to the author (see below).</i>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *
 * <b>Example</b>:<br>
 * If an instance of this servlet was mapped (using
 *       <code>&lt;web-app&gt;/WEB-INF/web.xml</code>) to:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <code>
 * &lt;web-app&gt;/cgi-bin/*
 * </code>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * then the following request:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <code>
 * http://localhost:8080/&lt;web-app&gt;/cgi-bin/dir1/script/pathinfo1
 * </code>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * would result in the execution of the script
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <code>
 * &lt;web-app-root&gt;/WEB-INF/cgi/dir1/script
 * </code>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * with the script's <code>PATH_INFO</code> set to <code>/pathinfo1</code>.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Recommendation:  House all your CGI scripts under
 * <code>&lt;webapp&gt;/WEB-INF/cgi</code>.  This will ensure that you do not
 * accidentally expose your cgi scripts' code to the outside world and that
 * your cgis will be cleanly ensconced underneath the WEB-INF (i.e.,
 * non-content) area.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The default CGI location is mentioned above.  You have the flexibility to
 * put CGIs wherever you want, however:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   The CGI search path will start at
 *   webAppRootDir + File.separator + cgiPathPrefix
 *   (or webAppRootDir alone if cgiPathPrefix is
 *   null).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   cgiPathPrefix is defined by setting
 *   this servlet's cgiPathPrefix init parameter

 *
 * <B>CGI Specification</B>:<br> derived from
 * <a href=""http://cgi-spec.golux.com"">http://cgi-spec.golux.com</a>.
 * A work-in-progress & expired Internet Draft.  Note no actual RFC describing
 * the CGI specification exists.  Where the behavior of this servlet differs
 * from the specification cited above, it is either documented here, a bug,
 * or an instance where the specification cited differs from Best
 * Community Practice (BCP).
 * Such instances should be well-documented here.  Please email the
 * <a href=""mailto:tomcat-dev@jakarta.apache.org"">Jakarta Tomcat group [tomcat-dev@jakarta.apache.org]</a>

 * <p>
 *
 * <b>Canonical metavariables</b>:<br>
 * The CGI specification defines the following canonical metavariables:
 * <br>
 * [excerpt from CGI specification]
 * <PRE>
 *  AUTH_TYPE
 *  CONTENT_LENGTH
 *  CONTENT_TYPE
 *  GATEWAY_INTERFACE
 *  PATH_INFO
 *  PATH_TRANSLATED
 *  QUERY_STRING
 *  REMOTE_ADDR
 *  REMOTE_HOST
 *  REMOTE_IDENT
 *  REMOTE_USER
 *  REQUEST_METHOD
 *  SCRIPT_NAME
 *  SERVER_NAME
 *  SERVER_PORT
 *  SERVER_PROTOCOL
 *  SERVER_SOFTWARE
 * </PRE>
 * <p>
 * Metavariables with names beginning with the protocol name (<EM>e.g.</EM>,
 * ""HTTP_ACCEPT"") are also canonical in their description of request header
 * fields.  The number and meaning of these fields may change independently
 * of this specification.  (See also section 6.1.5 [of the CGI specification].)
 * </p>
 * [end excerpt]
 *
 * </p>
 * <h2> Implementation notes</h2>
 * <p>
 *
 * <b>standard input handling</b>: If your script accepts standard input,
 * then the client must start sending input within a certain timeout period,
 * otherwise the servlet will assume no input is coming and carry on running
 * the script.  The script's the standard input will be closed and handling of
 * any further input from the client is undefined.  Most likely it will be
 * ignored.  If this behavior becomes undesirable, then this servlet needs
 * to be enhanced to handle threading of the spawned process' stdin, stdout,
 * and stderr (which should not be too hard).
 * <br>
 * If you find your cgi scripts are timing out receiving input, you can set
 * the init parameter <code></code> of your webapps' cgi-handling servlet
 * to be
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *
 * <b>Metavariable Values</b>: According to the CGI specificion,
 * implementations may choose to represent both null or missing values in an
 * implementation-specific manner, but must define that manner.  This
 * implementation chooses to always define all required metavariables, but
 * set the value to """" for all metavariables whose value is either null or
 * undefined.  PATH_TRANSLATED is the sole exception to this rule, as per the
 * CGI Specification.
 *
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *
 * <b>NPH --  Non-parsed-header implementation</b>:  This implementation does
 * not support the CGI NPH concept, whereby server ensures that the data
 * supplied to the script are preceisely as supplied by the client and
 * unaltered by the server.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The function of a servlet container (including Tomcat) is specifically
 * designed to parse and possible alter CGI-specific variables, and as
 * such makes NPH functionality difficult to support.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The CGI specification states that compliant servers MAY support NPH output.
 * It does not state servers MUST support NPH output to be unconditionally
 * compliant.  Thus, this implementation maintains unconditional compliance
 * with the specification though NPH support is not present.
 * </p>
 * <p>

 * The CGI specification is located at
 * <a href=""http://cgi-spec.golux.com"">http://cgi-spec.golux.com</a>.

 * <h3>TODO:</h3>
 * <ul>
 * <li> Support for setting headers (for example, Location headers don't work)
 * <li> Support for collapsing multiple header lines (per RFC 2616)
 * <li> Ensure handling of POST method does not interfere with 2.3 Filters
 * <li> Refactor some debug code out of core

 * <li> Possibly rewrite CGIRunner.run()?
 * <li> Possibly refactor CGIRunner and CGIEnvironment as non-inner classes?

 * <li> Revisit IOException handling in CGIRunner.run()
 * <li> Better documentation

 * <h2> Implementation notes</h2>
 * <p>
 *
 * <b>standard input handling</b>: If your script accepts standard input,
 * then the client must start sending input within a certain timeout period,
 * otherwise the servlet will assume no input is coming and carry on running
 * the script.  The script's the standard input will be closed and handling of
 * any further input from the client is undefined.  Most likely it will be
 * ignored.  If this behavior becomes undesirable, then this servlet needs
 * to be enhanced to handle threading of the spawned process' stdin, stdout,
 * and stderr (which should not be too hard).
 * <br>
 * If you find your cgi scripts are timing out receiving input, you can set
 * the init parameter <code></code> of your webapps' cgi-handling servlet
 * to be
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *
 * <b>Metavariable Values</b>: According to the CGI specificion,
 * implementations may choose to represent both null or missing values in an
 * implementation-specific manner, but must define that manner.  This
 * implementation chooses to always define all required metavariables, but
 * set the value to """" for all metavariables whose value is either null or
 * undefined.  PATH_TRANSLATED is the sole exception to this rule, as per the
 * CGI Specification.
 *
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *
 * <b>NPH --  Non-parsed-header implementation</b>:  This implementation does
 * not support the CGI NPH concept, whereby server ensures that the data
 * supplied to the script are preceisely as supplied by the client and
 * unaltered by the server.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The function of a servlet container (including Tomcat) is specifically
 * designed to parse and possible alter CGI-specific variables, and as
 * such makes NPH functionality difficult to support.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The CGI specification states that compliant servers MAY support NPH output.
 * It does not state servers MUST support NPH output to be unconditionally
 * compliant.  Thus, this implementation maintains unconditional compliance
 * with the specification though NPH support is not present.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *
 * The CGI specification is located at
 * <a href=""http://cgi-spec.golux.com"">http://cgi-spec.golux.com</a>.

 * <h3>TODO:</h3>
 * <ul>
 * <li> Support for setting headers (for example, Location headers don't work)
 * <li> Support for collapsing multiple header lines (per RFC 2616)
