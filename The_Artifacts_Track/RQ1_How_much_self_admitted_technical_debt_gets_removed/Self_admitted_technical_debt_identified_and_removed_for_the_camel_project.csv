 * You may want to just implement a custom {@link ThreadPoolFactory} and rely on the
 * {@link org.apache.camel.impl.DefaultExecutorServiceManager}, if that is sufficient. The {@link ThreadPoolFactory}
 * is always used for creating the actual thread pools. You can implement a custom {@link ThreadPoolFactory}
 * to leverage the WorkManager for a JEE server.

 * The {@link ThreadPoolFactory} has pure JDK API, where as this {@link ExecutorServiceManager} has Camel API
 * concepts such as {@link ThreadPoolProfile}. Therefore it may be easier to only implement a custom
 * {@link ThreadPoolFactory}.
 * <p/>
 * This manager has fine grained methods for creating various thread pools, however custom strategies
 * do not have to exactly create those kind of pools. Feel free to return a shared or different kind of pool.
 * <p/>
 * If you use the <tt>newXXX</tt> methods to create thread pools, then Camel will by default take care of
