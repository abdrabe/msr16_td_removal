The viewFs file system is implemented completely in memory on * the client side. The client-side mount table allows a client to provide a  * customized view of a file system namespace that is composed from  * one or more individual file systems (a localFs or Hdfs, S3fs, etc). * For example one could have a mount table that provides links such as * <ul> * <li>  /user          -> hdfs://nnContainingUserDir/user * <li>  /project/foo   -> hdfs://nnProject1/projects/foo * <li>  /project/bar   -> hdfs://nnProject2/projects/bar * <li>  /tmp           -> hdfs://nnTmp/privateTmpForUserXXX * </ul>  *  * ViewFs is specified with the following URI: <b>viewfs:///</b>  * <p> * To use viewfs one would typically set the default file system in the * config  (i.e. fs.default.name< = viewfs:///) along with the * mount table config variables as described below.  *  * <p> * <b> ** Config variables to specify the mount table entries ** </b> * <p> *  * The file system is initialized from the standard Hadoop config through * config variables. * See {@link FsConstants} for URI and Scheme constants;  * See {@link Constants} for config var constants;  * see {@link ConfigUtil} for convenient lib. *  * <p> * All the mount table config entries for view fs are prefixed by  * <b>fs.viewfs.mounttable.</b> * For example the above example can be specified with the following *  config variables: *  <ul> *  <li> fs.viewfs.mounttable.default.link./user= *  hdfs://nnContainingUserDir/user *  <li> fs.viewfs.mounttable.default.link./project/foo= *  hdfs://nnProject1/projects/foo *  <li> fs.viewfs.mounttable.default.link./project/bar= *  hdfs://nnProject2/projects/bar *  <li> fs.viewfs.mounttable.default.link./tmp= *  hdfs://nnTmp/privateTmpForUserXXX *  </ul> *   * The default mount table (when no authority is specified) is  * from config variables prefixed by <b>fs.viewFs.mounttable.default </b> * The authority component of a URI can be used to specify a different mount * table. For example, * <ul> * <li>  viewfs://sanjayMountable/ * </ul> * is initialized from fs.viewFs.mounttable.sanjayMountable.* config variables. *  *  <p>  *  <b> **** Merge Mounts **** </b>(NOTE: merge mounts are not implemented yet.) *  <p> *   *   One can also use ""MergeMounts"" to merge several directories (this is *   sometimes  called union-mounts or junction-mounts in the literature. *   For example of the home directories are stored on say two file systems *   (because they do not fit on one) then one could specify a mount *   entry such as following merges two dirs: *   <ul> *   <li> /user -> hdfs://nnUser1/user,hdfs://nnUser2/user *   </ul> *  Such a mergeLink can be specified with the following config var where "","" *  is used as the separator for each of links to be merged: *  <ul> *  <li> fs.viewfs.mounttable.default.linkMerge./user= *  hdfs://nnUser1/user,hdfs://nnUser1/user *  </ul> *   A special case of the merge mount is where mount table's root is merged *   with the root (slash) of another file system: *   <ul> *   <li>    fs.viewfs.mounttable.default.linkMergeSlash=hdfs://nn99/ *   </ul> *   In this cases the root of the mount table is merged with the root of *            <b>hdfs://nn99/ </b>  */",60,141,f1c74df922058e88791ed6971bbb96b53f6770f1,Sanjay Radia ,2011-05-06 2:11,,f,,,,
