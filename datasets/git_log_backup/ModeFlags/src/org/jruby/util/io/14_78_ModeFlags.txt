    Fix more references to CPL.
    
    The phrase "Common Public License" was split across two lines in
    our default header, which caused it to be missed during earlier
    search/replace. Also, we did not replace the CPL URL in the
    header with the EPL URL.

    Switch JRuby's CPL license to EPL.
    
    Governance of the CPL license was moved to the Eclipse Foundation
    at some point in the past, and Eclipse blessed the EPL (Eclipse
    Public License v1.0) as the successor to CPL. Because the CPL
    contains a clause allowing transparent upgrades to future blessed
    successor licenses, we can make the move to EPL without
    re-contacting past contributors.
    
    The change in going from CPL to EPL largely just removes some
    punitive language that apparently made many companies nervous. All
    other language in the license remains identical.
    
    Several documents about Eclipse's move from CPL to EPL are here:
    
    http://www.eclipse.org/legal/cpl2epl/
    
    Note that Eclipse's move came before the blessing of EPL as the
    upgrade path for CPL, so they had to do a bit more legal juggling.
    With Eclipse now the administrator of CPL and with their blessing
    of EPL as the upgrade path for CPL, all we need to do is make the
    move.

    Partially fix JRUBY-6893: fcntl(Fcntl::F_GETFL) always return 0
    
    I implemented F_GETFL for the basic read, write, and readwrite
    modes, but there's obviously other flags we could fill out here.
    
    Unfortunately, tests for fcntl appear to be almost nonexistent,
    even in MRI.

    More encoding-related IO cleanup.
    
    * Restore some old public signatures
    * Remove some private deprecated code
    * Remove more propagation of InvalidValueException
    
    Almost green...

    JRUBY-3944: process :binmode option
    
    The :binmode option, when set to TRUE, is ORed in with flags from the mode string or
    :mode option, as it is in MRI 1.9.2. Tested in rubyspec; both MRI and this code pass
    new tests for :binmode, and the existing jruby 1.6.5 code fails as expected.
