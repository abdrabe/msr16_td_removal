    Fix JRUBY-6932
    
    ruby block without arguments for itemStateChanged in 1.9 can fail
    
    We were forcing all blocks-as-interfaces to be LAMBDA, rather than
    just going with the natural type of the block. Changed to use
    natural type.

    Fix JRUBY-5980: Unable to call varargs constructor with 0 arguments.
    
    * Allow zero args to match a method with only varargs

    Miscellaneous cleanup:
    
    * A number of findbugs items in the "threadsafe", "performance", "malcious code", and "experimental" warnings
    * Tidied up all NetBeans "yellows" in the files I touched
    * Removed now-defunct JRubyServer/Client/Service
    * Removed now-defunct ssa.rb and DAGBuilder

    Miscellaneous perf improvements for Ruby to Java dispatch:
    
    * Fix primitive return type coercion to actually use the precached converter, rather than doing a hash hit every time
    * Eliminate an instanceof check that would actually constitute a bug, and shouldn't be seen at runtime
    * Eliminate synchronization and volatility on every call by removing laziness in RubyToJavaInvoker initialization

    Move JavaCallable construction logic up into RubyToJavaInvoker using abstract creator/accessors in the method/constructor-related subclasses.

    Varargs support for method dispatch! Should fix JRUBY-195, but I don't like the impl much so far. Needs additional cleanup.

    Eliminate some and reduce other setAccessible calls for JRUBY-4246.
    
    * For all methods in all classes encountered by JRuby, we were doing setAccessible one at a time. This meant that even if the class was never directly used (and lazily initialized) we still called setAccessible for all methods. For classes that were directly used, we ended up doing a second round of setAccessible calls for each named group of methods. The latter remains, but is now the only setAccessible for methods and constructors.
    * All fields were being setAccessible. In the case of static public final fields, which we create constants for, this was obviously unnecessary. In the case of regular fields, we only ever retrieved the list of public fields, so it was again unnecessary. Also note that in both cases we did the setAccessible calls eagerly.

    Improvements to JavaProxy-wrapped Java objects:
    
    * Lazily allocate the inner JavaObject, so if we don't use it we never create it.
    * Don't enter newly-constructed Objects into the proxy cache immediately.

    Same refactoring for constructors as for methods:
    
    * Delay constructing arg array as long as possible
    * Simplify return path
    * Cleanup, refactoring for readability
