commit fb1bd760e55a13fa6f23038fcb5031df17df7481
Author: Charles Oliver Nutter <headius@headius.com>
Date:   Tue Jun 25 15:06:39 2013 -0500

    Properly raise when a file cannot be created exclusively.
    
    Our logic did not atomically ensure a file would be created
    exclusively. It did a pre-create check to see if the file existed
    and would raise an error if exclusive creation was requested. If
    the file did not exist, it proceeded to do the proper atomic
    create call but ignore the return value. Another thread (or
    process) could jump in between these two operations and create the
    file. Our logic would then proceed to open a file it intended to
    have created exclusively but which was actually created by another
    thread or process.
    
    The fix is simple: raise if an exclusive create fails and
    exclusive creation was requested.
    
    Fixes #827, and a rubyspec is in rubyspec/rubyspec#231.

    Get real fileno from UNIX sockets/servers.

    Work harder to unwrap incoming channels to get their real fileno.
    
    This fixes JRUBY-7173, in which pipe channels are not stat'able
    because we simulate fileno rather than providing a real fileno.
    This change should work for most native channels; I tested files,
    pipes, and sockets. It will work for subprocess channels as well,
    but only where they are unwrappable (see note in the commit about
    problems unwrapping on Java 7). When we move to a more direct,
    native process-launching API we'll be able to do a better job
    with those channels.

    Restore use of FileOutputStream in ChannelDescriptor.
    
    We use FileOutputStream here because it can handle append mode
    for us, as opposed to RandomAccessFile which requires us to do
    our own seeking. I am restoring this with documentation and Jose
    will provide a new patch that only flips to RAF when we need to
    provide an offset.

    Fix more references to CPL.
    
    The phrase "Common Public License" was split across two lines in
    our default header, which caused it to be missed during earlier
    search/replace. Also, we did not replace the CPL URL in the
    header with the EPL URL.

    Switch JRuby's CPL license to EPL.
    
    Governance of the CPL license was moved to the Eclipse Foundation
    at some point in the past, and Eclipse blessed the EPL (Eclipse
    Public License v1.0) as the successor to CPL. Because the CPL
    contains a clause allowing transparent upgrades to future blessed
    successor licenses, we can make the move to EPL without
    re-contacting past contributors.
    
    The change in going from CPL to EPL largely just removes some
    punitive language that apparently made many companies nervous. All
    other language in the license remains identical.
    
    Several documents about Eclipse's move from CPL to EPL are here:
    
    http://www.eclipse.org/legal/cpl2epl/
    
    Note that Eclipse's move came before the blessing of EPL as the
    upgrade path for CPL, so they had to do a bit more legal juggling.
    With Eclipse now the administrator of CPL and with their blessing
    of EPL as the upgrade path for CPL, all we need to do is make the
    move.

    Fix JRUBY-6780
    
    File.open creates file without permissions
    
    Two fixes:
    
    * We were using a numeric arg[1] from File.open as permission.
    Permission is always passed as a third argument (or perhaps as a
    hash argument). Removed the relevant code, since we had other
    logic to properly handle permission elsewhere.
    * Append modes should not seek to the end of the file immediately;
    rather, they seek only on each write. Because the above change
    fixed how we handled a+ mode, this other bug was exposed. Fixed by
    removing a seek-to-end on file open.

    Fix JRUBY-6280: Fails to open fifo for writing.
    
    It turns out that in glibc, fopen operations that would seek in
    the resulting file descriptor do actually check for ESPIPE to know
    that a failed seek is due to the file being a pipe or FIFO. We do
    not have direct access to the actual ESPIPE, but we can check the
    IOException message to know if it's the same problem.
    
    I don't think there's any real risk in this change, since it will
    only quietly fail to seek on a file when it's impossible to seek
    on that file, which is what we want. Other error cases and open
    failures should propagate as before.

    Rework fileno/descriptor registration to live entirely within ChannelDescriptor. This avoids descriptors being unregistered prematurely by RubyIO finalization, eliminates RubyIO finalization, and centralizes registration much more neatly. An additional map is added to Ruby to allow 0, 1, and 2 to always map to the current runtime's notion of in, out, and err.

    JRUBY-4378: JIRB from jnlp over HTTP is broken
    
    Also, introduced classpath:/ scheme to load resources
    from the classpath.
    
    For example, JRuby's home can be set to:
    classpath:/META-INF/jruby.home
    and that should be pretty functional.
    
    But there are severe limitations, like there is
    no proper globbing, and that makes rubygems non-functional.
    
    For now, classpath:/-style home is set only
    for weird cases, like jnlp over HTTP. For regular/typcial
    jruby-complete.jar stuff, we still use jar:file.

    Fix for JRUBY-3012: Rake tasks are empty in Mr. Bones' generated project under JRuby
    
    The actual problem here was in repeated reopenings of stdio streams. The logic to dup2 the incoming descriptor's contents "into" the stdio descriptor was wiping out the original stdio fileno. As a result, future reopens did not follow the descriptor-preserving path and the stdio stream ended up getting closed. Because we can't really dup stdio descriptors on JVM, we have separate logic for reopen to prevent this, but it is keyed off fileno and so failed to fire the second time.
