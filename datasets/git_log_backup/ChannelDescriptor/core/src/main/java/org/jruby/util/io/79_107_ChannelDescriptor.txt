    ensure relative paths do NOT load unless "." is on $LOAD_PATH
    
    there is an extra search on "." necessary otherwise the relative path
    will be found via the classloader. the regular mri spec does not fail
    since current directory in java is independent from the current directory
    in ruby

    Restore minimal part of old IO for jossl 0.9.5 to work.

    Eliminate remnants of old IO backend and localize fileno map.
    
    The old Stream/ChannelStream/ChannelDescriptor code is no more.
    Instead, JRuby 9000 uses a fresh port of MRI's IO and transcoding
    logic, which then builds off a much thinner fileno shim using NIO
    channels. This comment removes the old logic, which is no longer
    used.
    
    Utility methods and constants from those classes have been moved
    to more appropriate places, and the old internal/external fileno
    map -- which used to be static -- is now managed on a per-runtime
    basis. For most users running a single JRuby instance with full
    native-call capabilities, this map will not come into play much,
    but it is still used to find existing ChannelFD wrappers around a
    given channel, and must be managed independently from runtime to
    runtime.

    IO work continues.
    
    * Reopen work and refactorign to support it.
    * PosixShim class to make POSIX and NIO both look like POSIX.
    * FilenoUtil class to handle fileno (real/fake) management.
    * Myriad minor refactorings and cleanups.

    Implement BasicSocket.for_fd and related fixes.
    
    * for_fd consumes the given fileno/descriptor and initializes the
      type of socket for_fd is called against (TCPServer, etc).
    * RubyTCPServer no longer keeps a separate reference to the server
      channel nor the address, to allow for_fd initialization.
    * ChannelDescriptor will now also not decrement the reference
      count during finish logic unless close is specified. With the
      old logic, non-closing finish would still produce an error on
      future non-closing finish when it should do nothing at all.

    Partial re-port of reopen to handle modes better. Fixes #1104.
    
    This is only a partial re-port of MRI reopen logic, but it does
    a better job of propagating the incoming IO's modes to the new
    stream/descriptor under the covers. The cases given in the bug now
    pass and I will try to come up with a good test case for them.
