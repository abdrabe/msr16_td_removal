    Fix more references to CPL.
    
    The phrase "Common Public License" was split across two lines in
    our default header, which caused it to be missed during earlier
    search/replace. Also, we did not replace the CPL URL in the
    header with the EPL URL.

    Switch JRuby's CPL license to EPL.
    
    Governance of the CPL license was moved to the Eclipse Foundation
    at some point in the past, and Eclipse blessed the EPL (Eclipse
    Public License v1.0) as the successor to CPL. Because the CPL
    contains a clause allowing transparent upgrades to future blessed
    successor licenses, we can make the move to EPL without
    re-contacting past contributors.
    
    The change in going from CPL to EPL largely just removes some
    punitive language that apparently made many companies nervous. All
    other language in the license remains identical.
    
    Several documents about Eclipse's move from CPL to EPL are here:
    
    http://www.eclipse.org/legal/cpl2epl/
    
    Note that Eclipse's move came before the blessing of EPL as the
    upgrade path for CPL, so they had to do a bit more legal juggling.
    With Eclipse now the administrator of CPL and with their blessing
    of EPL as the upgrade path for CPL, all we need to do is make the
    move.

    Fix JRUBY-6865
    
    JRuby allows invalid attr_accessor (MRI raises exception)
    
    Our test for local variable names (which applies in both JRuby and
    MRI to attr names) did not check for trailing ?. I added that one
    case.
    
    Note that in MRI all of this passes through ID parsing, which has
    logic for checking the type of ID I did not attempt to sort out.
    There are other cases we probably let through that MRI does not.
    
    Test submitted to MRI via https://github.com/ruby/ruby/pull/171

    Get MRI's tests running in JRuby's test suite.
    
    * Get minitest/excludes.rb in for minitest exclude support
    * Update test/externals/ruby1.9/*
    * Fixes to get tests running:
    ** Add dummy "continuation" library
    ** Add dummy "io/nonblock" library
    ** Fixes to Psych{Parser,Emitter} for recent changes to Psych proper
    ** Be more permissive on constant names, to allow encodings
    * Update externals for previously unexcluded failures

    Lexer jumbo patch.  Speeds up general parsing 10-15%.  Cold parses are about 30% faster.   Code has been refactored to the point that additional optimizations can be considered (like bytelist identifiers for alloc-less identifiers; same for uninterpolated string nodes).
    
    intern'ing of identifiers now happen in lexer rather than being smattered through AST
    Reader -> InputStream for LexerSource
    A new ByteList LexerSource for evals
    
    Additional bugs fixed:
    JRUBY-1408: JRuby crashes with error: can't find string "EOF" anywhere before EOF (SyntaxError)
    JRUBY-1443: Wrong position information for a CallNode with parentheses
    JRUBY-1435: YieldNodes sometimes have wrong position information
    JRUBY-1416: eval of a "proc" with setting the line number for something lower than 1 to adjust the line number causes "java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: -1 (NativeException)"
    JRUBY-1432: NFE from RubyYaccLexer.yylex

    Landing 'enebo' branch.  Most notable:
    - Merge in fixes from original refactoring patch form Mirko and friends.
    - Fixes many many positioning issues.
    - Simplify and refactor portions of lexing and parsing.
    - Reduce gratuitious object creation (like making a token which immediately
       becomes a node).
    - Comments are now added to parser result as a list.  IDE people can
      do a second pass to associate these nodes to the appropriate AST nodes.
    - offsets in ISourcePosition now represent a position 'between' characters.
