    Cleanup and centralize all property-based configuration settings.
    
    Properties for JRuby are now all in one location, combined with information
    on valid options, defaults, and description. All properties going forward
    should follow the same format, to ensure they're documented in the jruby
    --properties output.
    
    I have added to this new form all properties I thought were interesting to
    expose. There are a few still hidden that may be deleted soon.
    
    I also removed some long-defunct properties and removed unused code that related
    to them.

    Fix JRUBY-5322: NPE forcing to compile a script
    
    * Refactor backtrace style into TraceType enum
    * Move raw/full/ruby backtrace-gathering logic into TraceType
    * Move MRI/Rubinus backtrace-printing logic into TraceType
    * Fix Main toplevel exception handling to print using TraceType

    * Fix failed script compile to bail out, rather than NPE
    * Refactor Main into cleaner pieces

    Improvements for NailMain:
    
    * Use a single ClassCache across runs, to avoid re-jitting and re-loading code in each instance
    * Fire a System.gc after releasing the client, to avoid repeat calls growing the heap unnecessarily

    JRUBY-1650: "exit 0" not causing expected behaviour
    
    Main.run now returns a Status object, instead of an int, that can indicate
    if this is an explicit or implicit exit.
    
    Based on patch by Andrew Wason, with tweaks.

    Clean up Main to use the config's error output and NailMain to handle raised exceptions properly (eliminates "MainExitException logging on NG server).

    Start of work to make Nailgun a viable option for running JRuby:
    
    * Build in NG java stuff by default
    * Include tool/nailgun in bin dist
    * Merge jruby-ng and jruby-ng-server functionality into main jruby script
