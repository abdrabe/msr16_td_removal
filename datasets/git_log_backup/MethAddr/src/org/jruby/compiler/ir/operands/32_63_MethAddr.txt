    Fixed IR for alias nodes (right now, relying on ruby internal calls instruction -- probably should change to their own IR instructions at some point)

    - Some more progress towards integrating closures into analyses & optimizations; Next step: integrating them into LVA.

    - [ Hmm .. git newbie here .. somehow lost the commit .. trying again ] Fixed couple bugs with scope canonicalization; implemented ir output as a compiler pass; added code-version-token for IR_Method and added several method stubs to start optimizing calls

    - First pass of copy & constant propagation peephole opt. in place.  Compound values are not handled correcty yet.  I can only propagate the reference to the compound value, not the entire value.  Will fix this in next round of fixes.

    - Cleaned up code some more and added operand simplification methods for use in peephole opts. and later sccp passes.

    - Moved all operands to operands/ and instructions to instructions/ and fixed up imports.  Added some commented out code to start running peephole opts on the IR -- which will also serve as a basis for SCCP passes later on.
