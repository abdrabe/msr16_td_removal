    Do not persist filename in IR; require it when loading.
    
    Fixes #3109
    
    Because compiled scripts may be moved around or loaded from
    locations different than when they were compiled, we must pass
    filename into the decoding process to allow the script to reflect
    the new filename.

    Get AOT-compiled scripts loading properly again. Fixes #3018
    
    Note that there's still one missing piece, as detailed in #3109:
    we are not updating loaded scripts with their actual filename. The
    original filename they were compiled from is still there, which
    may cause problems with require_relative and friends.
