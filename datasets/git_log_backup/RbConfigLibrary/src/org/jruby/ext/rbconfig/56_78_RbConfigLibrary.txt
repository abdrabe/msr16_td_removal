    Incorporate substantive code from 2.0 stdlib.
    
    This commit only pulls in the parts of 2.0 stdlib that differ
    functionality-wise from their 1.9.3 equivalents. When running in
    2.0 mode, the 2.0 dir will be searched before the 1.9 dir,
    picking up the differing files. We opted to do this to reduce the
    amount of duplicate content in our repository.
    
    JRuby 9000 will likely incorporate 2.0 stdlib en masse, and may
    only be 2.0 compatible.
    
    Note that 2.0 stdlib is *not* included in jruby-complete or
    jruby-jars, since it is still an unsupported mode and we don't
    want to bloat up those artifacts any more than necessary.

    Fix more references to CPL.
    
    The phrase "Common Public License" was split across two lines in
    our default header, which caused it to be missed during earlier
    search/replace. Also, we did not replace the CPL URL in the
    header with the EPL URL.

    Switch JRuby's CPL license to EPL.
    
    Governance of the CPL license was moved to the Eclipse Foundation
    at some point in the past, and Eclipse blessed the EPL (Eclipse
    Public License v1.0) as the successor to CPL. Because the CPL
    contains a clause allowing transparent upgrades to future blessed
    successor licenses, we can make the move to EPL without
    re-contacting past contributors.
    
    The change in going from CPL to EPL largely just removes some
    punitive language that apparently made many companies nervous. All
    other language in the license remains identical.
    
    Several documents about Eclipse's move from CPL to EPL are here:
    
    http://www.eclipse.org/legal/cpl2epl/
    
    Note that Eclipse's move came before the blessing of EPL as the
    upgrade path for CPL, so they had to do a bit more legal juggling.
    With Eclipse now the administrator of CPL and with their blessing
    of EPL as the upgrade path for CPL, all we need to do is make the
    move.

    Include runtime version in site dir
    
    I forgot this during doing the path rework, I think it's not used by anyone except me for Fedora packaging, so it can safely be merged into 1.7 tree.

    Bump macosx-version-min from 10.4 to 10.5.
    
    With this set at 10.4 the MacOS X compiler complains about '-rpath' only
    being applicable to 10.5 and above (noticed during 'gem install
    mysql2').  Bump it to 10.5 and the error is gone.
