    Optimizations to proc invocation to reduce allocation.
    
    * Do not clone block if we aren't modifying frame self
    * Do not create intermediate lists for 1.9 args setup
    * Use preallocated, frozen Array for intermediate Array of size 0

    Fix more references to CPL.
    
    The phrase "Common Public License" was split across two lines in
    our default header, which caused it to be missed during earlier
    search/replace. Also, we did not replace the CPL URL in the
    header with the EPL URL.

    Switch JRuby's CPL license to EPL.
    
    Governance of the CPL license was moved to the Eclipse Foundation
    at some point in the past, and Eclipse blessed the EPL (Eclipse
    Public License v1.0) as the successor to CPL. Because the CPL
    contains a clause allowing transparent upgrades to future blessed
    successor licenses, we can make the move to EPL without
    re-contacting past contributors.
    
    The change in going from CPL to EPL largely just removes some
    punitive language that apparently made many companies nervous. All
    other language in the license remains identical.
    
    Several documents about Eclipse's move from CPL to EPL are here:
    
    http://www.eclipse.org/legal/cpl2epl/
    
    Note that Eclipse's move came before the blessing of EPL as the
    upgrade path for CPL, so they had to do a bit more legal juggling.
    With Eclipse now the administrator of CPL and with their blessing
    of EPL as the upgrade path for CPL, all we need to do is make the
    move.

    Fix JRUBY-6367.
    
    --pre command line switch not working in 1.9 runtime
    
    This is actually broken in both 1.8 and 1.9 modes, but only 1.9's
    optparse exposed it. We were not properly passing blocks through
    procified Method objects. Fixed MethodBlock and RubyMethod.bmcall
    to do that.

    Remove class name from backtrace data.
    
    Class name was only used for Rubinius backtraces, which nobody is
    using. JRuby's default backtrace is now very similar, so I've
    removed the Rubinius format completely. Also, for JRUBY-6218, we
    regressed on interpreter performance because class names are no
    longer cached. Also, in compiled Ruby code, the class names are not
    available most of the time. All this combined to convince me to just
    remove class name from the backtrace data.
    
    The "rubinius" backtrace style setting still works, but does not
    change anything (just uses the "jruby" style).
    
    This fixes the perf regression for the interpreter, but does not
    do anything to generally fix the regression for Class/Module name
    calculation performance.

        Fix remaining failures for test-all.
    
        * Disable CheckClassAdapter temporarily, since it disallows what should be valid JVM identifiers.
        * Use the presence of $RUBY$ in method name as an additional indicator that we're processing a compiled Ruby body during backtrace gathering.
        * Move some largely-static properties out of "init" target in build.xml, so they're available whether init is triggered or not (e.g. run.jvm.model).

        * test_trace_func had been hacked for a bad class result (Integer, instead of Fixnum)...fixed that

    Date:   Tue Sep 28 15:40:38 2010 -0500
    
        Fixes to get specs a bit closer to running green.
    
        * Move pre/post logic for Script.load into generated code, so it's the same everywhere.
        * Make pre/post-load push a frame, so top-level of a script is always framed
        * Remove break handling from non-literal block call paths in CachingCallSite
        * Make sure all literal block calls are using CallSite.callIter, which handles break
        * Fix a bad test in testCompiler that needed visibility tweaks and framing
        * Add complete doco for CallSite
        * Fix Kernel#caller to trim from top of stack instead of bottom

        Performance changes for backtrace logic:
    
        * Back off using Java stack trace for Proc's to_s file+line, since it's prohibitively expensive
        * Move the Backtrace stack to being a fixed-size array of objects updated, rather than created, when a push happens

        Fixes for jitted/compiled backtrace generation
    
        * SClass in a method body needs to frame, so it has a jump target for non-local return

        * Synthetic calls, like to rescue bodies, need to gobble caller frames to avoid multiple entries

    Rejigger how binding works with files and line numbers. It appears that we weren't tracking everything we needed in a binding. Instead of holding the current frame plus the current file+line, we held only the current frame. This led to us constantly setting and clearing the frame's line numbers in an attempt to get traces to line up. With binding carrying the original file+line, that juggling is no longer necessary. This fixes an eval spec and should improve backtraces across eval calls, which had numerous peculiarities before. This also fixes JRUBY-2328: Overriding require causes eval to give wrong __FILE__ in certain circumstances.

    Because Binding construction always duplicates the passed frame, any callers pre-duping were doing extra work. This logic may move back out of Binding at some point, to reduce the cost of constructing a new block, but for now it's simplest to centralize and de-duplicate it.

    House cleaning! Delete a bunch of unused and/or deprecated classes of strange and wonderful origins, eliminate all deprecated Callback-related code, reduce environment lookup to a simple System.getenv call, kill off the last of the old stackless interpreter's "Instruction" interface, and other miscellaneous cleanup.

commit 2c2a66b641fbccc9c04d41a7171f4f99172a143a
Author: Charles Oliver Nutter <headius@headius.com>
Date:   Sat Nov 24 11:27:21 2007 +0000

    A fairly extensive refactoring of the relationship between bindings, blocks, and eval. Binding holds the frame and *containing* scope; this allows the binding contained within a block to be use for evals directly, rather than requiring hacks like the previous commit. When a block is invoked, a new DynamicScope is constructed at that time, rather than having an existing scope cloned. Similarly for evals, the first time a binding is used getEvalScope is called on the binding's scope (the containing scope for the eval). This causes a new eval scope to be created the first time and used for subsequent calls with the same containing scope. And again, this avoids contortions when constructing the binding, since the binding only need to contain the unchanging containing scope.
    
    This should make it a lot easier to implement the remaining specific-size dynamic scopes. It also simplifies scoping/binding logic and fixes a number of eval/binding/scoping issues.

    Revert to type-specific JumpException subclasses to allow Java exception-handling to do more flow control work for us. Since most signs point to non-local returns (and other flow-control) in the upcoming Closures spec for Java using exceptions, this is going to safely remain into the future.

    Wow, suddenly it's possible to eliminate ICallable and impls completely. This specializes one more Block subclass and should make it possible for blocks to properly report some positioning errors. It should also remove a stack level from eval'ed node-based block execution.
