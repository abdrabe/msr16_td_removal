    * Moved FileNameMapper to framework.  Got rid of setTo() and setFrom()
      from the interface, as these are no longer needed.
    
    * Changed tasks to accept a FileNameMapper directly, rather than using Mapper.
    
    * Removed the 'flatten' attribute from the <copy> task.
    
    * Removed the 'ext' attribute from the <native2ascii> task.
    
    * Removed Mapper and MapperType.
    
    * Moved <flatten> mapper to antlib.
    
    * Made ExtMapper available as <map-extension> and moved to antlib.
    
    * Added <prefix> mapper, to apply a fixed prefix to names.
    
    * Added <chain> mapper, to apply a chain of mappers to names.
    
    * Added <mapped-fileset>, a fileset that transforms nested filesets using a mapper.
