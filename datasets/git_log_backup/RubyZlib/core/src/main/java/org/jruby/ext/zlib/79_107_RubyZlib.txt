    Use CRC-32 table from JZlib

    Inline CRC32Ext
    
    Compared to the inlined version of Adler32, this one unfortunately still
    relies on reflection for adjusting the starting checksum. This is due
    to the fact that crc32_combine is much more expensive, and completely
    dominates the runtime up to quite long byte lists.
    
    However, in the event that the reflection trick stops working, we now
    fall back to the slower approach, ensuring compatibility with an
    unlikely future Java release where the internal CRC32 field name is
    changed.
    
    Compared to CRC32Ext, however, neither the reflection nor the slow path
    is used when the starting checksum matches the default.

    Inline Adler32Ext
    
    As an improvement, the new implementation does not rely on reflection
    to adjust for a starting checksum. Instead, it uses adler32_combine, as
    that computation is reasonably cheap anyhow.
    
    Compared to Adler32Ext, the adjustment is also only performed when a
    starting checksum other than the default is provided.

    Rework some GZipWriter construction logic to fix #1088
    
    * Fix open->newInstance sequence so initialize has the right arity
    * Process level and strategy on the way in
    * Pass level to jzlib
    * Peel off opt hash correctly
    
    Still to do:
    
    * Pass strategy to jzlib
    * Match MRI call args for deflateInit2
    * Other tweakery to match MRI logic.
    
    See also #1108
