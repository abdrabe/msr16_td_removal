    Fix JRUBY-6932
    
    ruby block without arguments for itemStateChanged in 1.9 can fail
    
    We were forcing all blocks-as-interfaces to be LAMBDA, rather than
    just going with the natural type of the block. Changed to use
    natural type.

    Fix JRUBY-5980: Unable to call varargs constructor with 0 arguments.
    
    * Allow zero args to match a method with only varargs

    Miscellaneous perf improvements for Ruby to Java dispatch:
    
    * Fix primitive return type coercion to actually use the precached converter, rather than doing a hash hit every time
    * Eliminate an instanceof check that would actually constitute a bug, and shouldn't be seen at runtime
    * Eliminate synchronization and volatility on every call by removing laziness in RubyToJavaInvoker initialization

    Move JavaCallable construction logic up into RubyToJavaInvoker using abstract creator/accessors in the method/constructor-related subclasses.

    Varargs support for method dispatch! Should fix JRUBY-195, but I don't like the impl much so far. Needs additional cleanup.

    Add java_method to peel out a specific overloaded Java method for later selection-free invocation. Only for instance methods atm.

    Same refactoring for constructors as for methods:
    
    * Delay constructing arg array as long as possible
    * Simplify return path
    * Cleanup, refactoring for readability

    Eliminate a useless wrap/unwrap of uncoercible Java objects returning to Ruby. Doubled perf of calling such methods.

    Multiple cleanups, refactorings, improvements for standard Java invocation:
    
    * Eliminate use of JavaObject as much as possible
    * Delay boxing into an args array as late as possible, in preparation for generated handles
    * General cleanup of invokers
