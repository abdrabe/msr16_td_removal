    - First round of attempting to add alloc-frame, load-from-frame &
      store-to-frame instructions for closures.  2 separate dataflow passes
      to insert load and store instructions where required -- partially
      working, still some pieces to fall in place.

    - Cleaned up the scope setup some more; Integrated (not fully tested &
      debugged) closures into live variable anaysis code; Added instructions
      to allocate heap frame, load / store variables from frame (not
      integrated yet);

    - Bug fixes in ir and cfg construction; canonicalized cfg; added
      improved visit order to dataflow framework; first pass (stubs) at
      dealing with method aliases.

    - Some more code cleanup + implemented dead code elimination pass

    - First pass at implementing live variable analysis -- the cfg building / printing code needs tweaking; Need to implement dead code removal using results of lva.

    - Added dataflow analysis abstract classes -- different df problems (live var analysis, etc.) can be implemented as derived classes without having to rewrite common code across problems.
