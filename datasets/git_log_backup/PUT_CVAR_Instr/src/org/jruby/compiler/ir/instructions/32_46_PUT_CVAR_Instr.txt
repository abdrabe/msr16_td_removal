    - More cleanup of scoping and removing old crud from when I didn't understand some of the scoping semantics properly; Added a metaclass object to encapsulate construction of the metaclass and keep some code clean.  All of this will need couple more passes and some more fixup.

    - Moved all operands to operands/ and instructions to instructions/ and fixed up imports.  Added some commented out code to start running peephole opts on the IR -- which will also serve as a basis for SCCP passes later on.
