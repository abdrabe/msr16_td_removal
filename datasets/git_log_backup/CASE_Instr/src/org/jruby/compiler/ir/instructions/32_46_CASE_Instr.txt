    - First pass of copy & constant propagation peephole opt. in place.  Compound values are not handled correcty yet.  I can only propagate the reference to the compound value, not the entire value.  Will fix this in next round of fixes.

    - Moved all operands to operands/ and instructions to instructions/ and fixed up imports.  Added some commented out code to start running peephole opts on the IR -- which will also serve as a basis for SCCP passes later on.
