commit 8c97911720b40557d78672245bc2e7f724917297
Author: Peter Donald <donaldp@apache.org>
Date:   Mon Jan 8 04:36:48 2001 +0000

    Updated to the version on harddisk + added the start of documentation.
    
    Major changes include
    * making convertion API context-sensitive
    * the simplification of all the interfaces. The simplification is achived by applying IOC. Now AntEngine is responsible for creating and instantiating shared components via a ComponentManager.
    * Moved most of startup code to AntEngine so that alternate front ends can be added in simply.
