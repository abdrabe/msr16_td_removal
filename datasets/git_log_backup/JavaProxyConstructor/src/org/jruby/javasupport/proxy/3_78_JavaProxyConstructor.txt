    Fix more references to CPL.
    
    The phrase "Common Public License" was split across two lines in
    our default header, which caused it to be missed during earlier
    search/replace. Also, we did not replace the CPL URL in the
    header with the EPL URL.

    Switch JRuby's CPL license to EPL.
    
    Governance of the CPL license was moved to the Eclipse Foundation
    at some point in the past, and Eclipse blessed the EPL (Eclipse
    Public License v1.0) as the successor to CPL. Because the CPL
    contains a clause allowing transparent upgrades to future blessed
    successor licenses, we can make the move to EPL without
    re-contacting past contributors.
    
    The change in going from CPL to EPL largely just removes some
    punitive language that apparently made many companies nervous. All
    other language in the license remains identical.
    
    Several documents about Eclipse's move from CPL to EPL are here:
    
    http://www.eclipse.org/legal/cpl2epl/
    
    Note that Eclipse's move came before the blessing of EPL as the
    upgrade path for CPL, so they had to do a bit more legal juggling.
    With Eclipse now the administrator of CPL and with their blessing
    of EPL as the upgrade path for CPL, all we need to do is make the
    move.

    Fix JRUBY-4788: Stackoverflow when calling code from java with wrong parameters
    
    When dispatching to an abstract method, we checked if the Ruby arity matched the incoming arguments. If it did not, we unconditionally redispatched against the superclass. If the superclass method was abstract, this would pick up the JavaProxyMethod stub, dispatching again back through the mismatched-arity logic. This caused a stack overflow. By checking whether the superclass has a dispatchable method, we can properly present an ArgumentError instead.

        Fix remaining failures for test-all.
    
        * Disable CheckClassAdapter temporarily, since it disallows what should be valid JVM identifiers.
        * Use the presence of $RUBY$ in method name as an additional indicator that we're processing a compiled Ruby body during backtrace gathering.
        * Move some largely-static properties out of "init" target in build.xml, so they're available whether init is triggered or not (e.g. run.jvm.model).

        * tc_owned is a bad test and fails on system like OS X where (for some reason) / may be owned by user
        * test_trace_func had been hacked for a bad class result (Integer, instead of Fixnum)...fixed that

        * Fix ruby_test's IO.new suite to not use STDOUT directly, risking that it get closed

        * Back off using Java stack trace for Proc's to_s file+line, since it's prohibitively expensive

    Sweater unraveling for JRUBY-4615: java integration specs interference
    
    The original problem here was that depending on what order JI-related code was used, a different object could get cached for a java.lang.Class in ObjectProxyCache. Normally, it should just be the proxy wrapper, but some paths inserted a the RubyClass version of the class. This led to peculiar failures if specs were reordered.
    
    The fixes made here are as follows:
    
    * Eliminate all remaining to_java_object logic, which is where the bad OPC.put originated from
    * Move all coerce*ToJavaObject logic from JavaUtil into the appropriate toJava overrides
    * Fixes and modifications surrounding the above two changes

Author: Charles Oliver Nutter <headius@headius.com>
Date:   Thu Sep 24 09:30:24 2009 -0500

    More refactoring, more unification of coercion logic. Also a small improvement to the monkey-patched j.u.List#sort Comparable impl.

Author: Charles Oliver Nutter <headius@headius.com>
Date:   Tue Sep 22 12:27:32 2009 -0500

    More consistency fixes for JI coercion:
    * Move more places to calling toJava
    * Move code away from calling convertRubyToJava, the old clunky coercion path
    
    Two behavior changes are introduced by this commit:
    * When coming out of a collection (RubyArray, RubyHash) Fixnum will now coerce to the smallest java.lang.Number subtype its value can fit into. We already did this for calling methods that receive Object, but now also do it for many other cases of conversion to Object.
    * nil values can now be assigned to or passed for primitive fields or arguments; nil will coerce as "0" in the smallest Number type possible.

    * Eliminate visibility checking for almost all fcall and vcall paths.
    * Outline some method_missing logic
    * Start adding some specific-arity paths for method_missing; still too much boxing, but the code isn't in normal call paths now.

    The RC3 Surprise!
    
    Allow annotation defined ruby methods to optionally specify ThreadContext as first parameter
    Convert easiest and most common methods to accept ThreadContext when method or child method can use context
    
    These changes give about 15% improvement on petstore bench and about 10% in ar-bench.  In ar-bench getCurrentContext calls go from 14 million down to 2 million.  The remaining calls largely can be removed but they were much more invasive.
    
    IRubyObject op_eqq and op_equal both not have ThreadContext consumer, but we could see no use of this in any extensions and figured it worth the trouble of converting.

    Partial fix for JRUBY-2169: Round out methods in JI wrappers, and add support for 1.5 methods (for annotations, etc.).  Still more to do for JavaProxyConstructor and JavaProxyMethod (i.e., JRuby-defined subclass methods and ctors).  Includes some unit tests, could use more.
    
    Does not include some other needed work on low-level JI (see JRUBY-1976, for instance), or some perf work I hope to get in before 1.1.

    Fix for JRUBY-2069.  Problems with equals() and hashCode() methods caused every instantiation of a Ruby-defined Java subclass to add a new entry to the method match cache (in the same bucket!), since returned hashCode was that of the class, new constructors were returned on every call, and equals() would never return true.  So if you created 1000 instances, then 1000 entries were searched for the 1001st instantiation, and so on.
    
    Fixed equals/hashCode for other types as well, should improve method-matching speed in general.  (The new versions no longer call out to the Ruby hash and == methods; these are internal classes, after all.) I still plan to rework matching_method, as there are other issues.

    Eliminate two callMethod versions from IRubyObject, in favor of a few RuntimeHelpers.invoke* variants that go straight to invoke methods on the metaclass. This helps move invocation logic out of (I)RubyObject to reduce the implementation load. More to come.

    - Create a NULL_BLOCK to replace null checks against blocks:
      - Now isGiven() on a block tells you whether it is supplied or not
      - yield on the NULL_BLOCK throw the correct exception
        - We were not throwing this correctly by most callers with my landing of
          the block branch
        - We were generating NPE in cases where we called something that requires
          a block and supply none
    - Block.blockObject => Block.proc
     - Rename and type since this is just a convenience reference for association
       from block to what proc it might represent
    - Remove unused blockAtCreation (this may become relevent for Ruby 2 but why do
      it now
    - Remove ThreadContext and IRuby from Frame
    - Remove Scope
    - Put Visibility directly on Frame
    - callingzsuper dead code
    - Now that modules have a proper superclass we can get rid of special code in
      callSuper
    - ArgsPushNode.childNodes should not return null
