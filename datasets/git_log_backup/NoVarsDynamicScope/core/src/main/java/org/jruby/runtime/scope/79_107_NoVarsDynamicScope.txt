    - DynamicScope+children removed no longer used {get,set}ArgValues methods since they are dead.
    - ArgsNode getRest() replaced by hasRest() or retrieving getRestArgNode directly.
    - Slight rearrangement internally of fields in ArgsNode.
    - Remove accidental println from last commit.

    evalSimple path no longer has duplicated scope (messiness to be cleaned up after evalWithBinding
    removes its additionalScope).
    Reinstated NoVars assertion because we no longer erroneously ask 'phantom' scope for a block
    value which is never there...ooooooo spooky
    SClasses should not need to get closure

    Partially fix #2300 (3/4 of IR side).  No more magical storage in IREvalScope.
    More work coming from core/TC/DynamicScope side of things.  Disabled assert
    because for module_evals we are pushing 2 scopes when 1 would do and our value
    retrieval chokes on that.

    Revert "Generify scopes to Object, in preparation for using Object in"
    
    This reverts commit a57d94a4c02063e2df2c655fbe349d2b4769ba41.
    
    This change is right long term but breaks the current compiler in
    many unpleasant ways. Rather than sort them out, I'm reverting
    this for now. Once we switch to IR+JIT we should be able to
    reinstate this commit.

    Generify scopes to Object, in preparation for using Object in
    IR JIT.

    Move to @mkristian's proposed layout, with some modifications.
