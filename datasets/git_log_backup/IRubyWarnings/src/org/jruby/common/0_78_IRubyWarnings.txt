    Fix more references to CPL.
    
    The phrase "Common Public License" was split across two lines in
    our default header, which caused it to be missed during earlier
    search/replace. Also, we did not replace the CPL URL in the
    header with the EPL URL.

    Switch JRuby's CPL license to EPL.
    
    Governance of the CPL license was moved to the Eclipse Foundation
    at some point in the past, and Eclipse blessed the EPL (Eclipse
    Public License v1.0) as the successor to CPL. Because the CPL
    contains a clause allowing transparent upgrades to future blessed
    successor licenses, we can make the move to EPL without
    re-contacting past contributors.
    
    The change in going from CPL to EPL largely just removes some
    punitive language that apparently made many companies nervous. All
    other language in the license remains identical.
    
    Several documents about Eclipse's move from CPL to EPL are here:
    
    http://www.eclipse.org/legal/cpl2epl/
    
    Note that Eclipse's move came before the blessing of EPL as the
    upgrade path for CPL, so they had to do a bit more legal juggling.
    With Eclipse now the administrator of CPL and with their blessing
    of EPL as the upgrade path for CPL, all we need to do is make the
    move.

    Fix JRUBY-6949
    
    system() silently fails when options are passed
    
    I believe we were trying to coerce the hash args to String, which
    failed...and then the failure was swallowed due to another bug
    (already filed). This commit does not add options support, but
    does trim them off the end of the args array and warns (once) that
    they will be ignored. We plan to get the remaining process options
    working in 1.7.1, and there are numerous other bugs for that.

    Fix JRUBY-6859
    
    java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when using --profile.api . MAX_PROFILE_METHODS too low?
    
    This was actually fixed already in the 1.7 line in aabfa79f4 but
    this commit adds a warning (once) and configurable property to
    bump up the max size.

    Modify all Etc methods to return nil if there's any error (which generally would mean they are not supported on the current platform). This better matches Ruby behavior and should allow RubyGems 1.3.0 to work out of the box. See JRUBY-3094.

      - Removes need to manage extra fields in compiler reducing memory size of methods
      - Seperates setting of setting line and file (later commit will be doing a lot less setFile's)
    
    - Removed a chunk of dead code from RubyKernel.eval

    Remove extra sample scripts which were removed for 1.0
    Last of ablaf is gone (clean up from removing serialization before 1.0)
    Conditional support for parsing with/without extra positioning information for IDE:
      - For runtime this saves considerable amount of memory/object creation during parsing
      - Runtime can still parse with extra positioning information if desired
