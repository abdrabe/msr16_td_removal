    Don't warn on private attribute accessors to match CRuby
    
    I'm sorry for the back and forth on this one. I introduced it back in
    jruby/jruby#2637, but CRuby have recently removed the warning in
    https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/10967.

    Produce a warning on private attribute accessors
    
    People seem to do that a lot after Sandi's book and not many of them
    realize it actually produces a warning in CRuby.
    
    Tried getting TestModule#test_attr out of the CRuby excluded failures,
    because it was the only existing test I saw hinting of the behaviour,
    however it also test that attribute names can't be a invalid
    identifiers, which seems to go fine in JRuby.
