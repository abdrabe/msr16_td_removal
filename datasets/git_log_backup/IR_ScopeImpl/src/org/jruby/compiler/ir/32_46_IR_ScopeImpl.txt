Date:   Fri Dec 18 01:42:58 2009 -0600

    - More cleanup of scoping and removing old crud from when I didn't understand some of the scoping semantics properly; Added a metaclass object to encapsulate construction of the metaclass and keep some code clean.  All of this will need couple more passes and some more fixup.

Author: Subramanya Sastry <sss.lists@gmail.com>
Date:   Mon Nov 30 22:38:01 2009 -0600

    - First pass at generating IR for rescue blocks: probably buggy, incomplete (ensure blocks, retries, other fixmes) + not yet integrated into cfg generation.

Author: Subramanya Sastry <sss.lists@gmail.com>

    - First round of attempting to add alloc-frame, load-from-frame &
      store-to-frame instructions for closures.  2 separate dataflow passes
      to insert load and store instructions where required -- partially
      working, still some pieces to fall in place.

      code now successfully processed - ir built, cfg built, local opts
      done, dom tree built, lva done, dead code eliminated).

    - Cleaned up the scope setup some more; Integrated (not fully tested &
      debugged) closures into live variable anaysis code; Added instructions
      to allocate heap frame, load / store variables from frame (not
      integrated yet);

    - Closures are handled better w.r.t. IR printing + cfgs are built for
      closures too now + added a BUILD_CLOSURE IR instruction + fixed some
      bugs (can now build ir and cfg and run local opts on much larger code
      bodies).

    - Cleaned up code to enable running compiler passes without having to write a lot of same boilerplate code all the time.  This will keep evolving and changing.  Just the first pass.

    - First pass of copy & constant propagation peephole opt. in place.  Compound values are not handled correcty yet.  I can only propagate the reference to the compound value, not the entire value.  Will fix this in next round of fixes.

    - Moved all operands to operands/ and instructions to instructions/ and fixed up imports.  Added some commented out code to start running peephole opts on the IR -- which will also serve as a basis for SCCP passes later on.
