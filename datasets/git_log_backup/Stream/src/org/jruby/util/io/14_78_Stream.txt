    Fix more references to CPL.
    
    The phrase "Common Public License" was split across two lines in
    our default header, which caused it to be missed during earlier
    search/replace. Also, we did not replace the CPL URL in the
    header with the EPL URL.

    Switch JRuby's CPL license to EPL.
    
    Governance of the CPL license was moved to the Eclipse Foundation
    at some point in the past, and Eclipse blessed the EPL (Eclipse
    Public License v1.0) as the successor to CPL. Because the CPL
    contains a clause allowing transparent upgrades to future blessed
    successor licenses, we can make the move to EPL without
    re-contacting past contributors.
    
    The change in going from CPL to EPL largely just removes some
    punitive language that apparently made many companies nervous. All
    other language in the license remains identical.
    
    Several documents about Eclipse's move from CPL to EPL are here:
    
    http://www.eclipse.org/legal/cpl2epl/
    
    Note that Eclipse's move came before the blessing of EPL as the
    upgrade path for CPL, so they had to do a bit more legal juggling.
    With Eclipse now the administrator of CPL and with their blessing
    of EPL as the upgrade path for CPL, all we need to do is make the
    move.

    Fix JRUBY-6198: When calling dup on file open in binmode the new object does not respect binmode
    
    * binmode was propagated as a mode, but not as a flag on the underlying Stream.

    Alternative fix for JRUBY-5114: provide an autoclose flag on all IO objects that will allow turning off the close-on-finalize behavior. Also modified the "to_io" impls for InputStream, OutputStream, and Channel to take an :autoclose option.

    More robustness to the runtime clearing in ChannelStream, so it should never cause an NPE even in odd cases.
