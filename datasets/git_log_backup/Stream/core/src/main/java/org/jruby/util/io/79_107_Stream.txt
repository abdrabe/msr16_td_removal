    Eliminate remnants of old IO backend and localize fileno map.
    
    The old Stream/ChannelStream/ChannelDescriptor code is no more.
    Instead, JRuby 9000 uses a fresh port of MRI's IO and transcoding
    logic, which then builds off a much thinner fileno shim using NIO
    channels. This comment removes the old logic, which is no longer
    used.
    
    Utility methods and constants from those classes have been moved
    to more appropriate places, and the old internal/external fileno
    map -- which used to be static -- is now managed on a per-runtime
    basis. For most users running a single JRuby instance with full
    native-call capabilities, this map will not come into play much,
    but it is still used to find existing ChannelFD wrappers around a
    given channel, and must be managed independently from runtime to
    runtime.

    Partial re-port of reopen to handle modes better. Fixes #1104.
    
    This is only a partial re-port of MRI reopen logic, but it does
    a better job of propagating the incoming IO's modes to the new
    stream/descriptor under the covers. The cases given in the bug now
    pass and I will try to come up with a good test case for them.

    Move to @mkristian's proposed layout, with some modifications.
