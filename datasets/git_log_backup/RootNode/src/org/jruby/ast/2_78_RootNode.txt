    Fix more references to CPL.
    
    The phrase "Common Public License" was split across two lines in
    our default header, which caused it to be missed during earlier
    search/replace. Also, we did not replace the CPL URL in the
    header with the EPL URL.

    Switch JRuby's CPL license to EPL.
    
    Governance of the CPL license was moved to the Eclipse Foundation
    at some point in the past, and Eclipse blessed the EPL (Eclipse
    Public License v1.0) as the successor to CPL. Because the CPL
    contains a clause allowing transparent upgrades to future blessed
    successor licenses, we can make the move to EPL without
    re-contacting past contributors.
    
    The change in going from CPL to EPL largely just removes some
    punitive language that apparently made many companies nervous. All
    other language in the license remains identical.
    
    Several documents about Eclipse's move from CPL to EPL are here:
    
    http://www.eclipse.org/legal/cpl2epl/
    
    Note that Eclipse's move came before the blessing of EPL as the
    upgrade path for CPL, so they had to do a bit more legal juggling.
    With Eclipse now the administrator of CPL and with their blessing
    of EPL as the upgrade path for CPL, all we need to do is make the
    move.

    Bombs away! Eliinate nodeId field from Node and add a method to all nodes of interest to return the value instead. Probably a little slower, but we're moving away from using NodeType on critical path code and the memory savings are pretty substantial (4-8 bytes per node).

    House cleaning! Delete a bunch of unused and/or deprecated classes of strange and wonderful origins, eliminate all deprecated Callback-related code, reduce environment lookup to a simple System.getenv call, kill off the last of the old stackless interpreter's "Instruction" interface, and other miscellaneous cleanup.

    A couple more callAdapter additions to nodes that can support them

    Remove last vestiges of serialization from AST
    MethodIndex moved into DefaultAdapter
    Smaller smattering and things I cannot remember
