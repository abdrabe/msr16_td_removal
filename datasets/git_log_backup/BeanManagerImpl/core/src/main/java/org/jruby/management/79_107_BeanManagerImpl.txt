    Rip out the guts! Removing many non-9k runtime classes.
    
    * ClassCache is gone; it was hacky and problematic when compiled
      code held classloader-level (static) data, as when using indy
      call sites. Java 8 has also eliminated permgen, greatly reducing
      the hassle and overhead of loading jitted code. Finally, Rails
      and the other Ruby frameworks are now officially "thread safe"
      (or the teams are committed to them being so) and the multiple
      JRuby model of deployment is discouraged (or even deprecated).
    * All old JIT code is gone. It won't be useful for the new
      JIT.
    * Removed the last vestiges of Callback-based functions. If I
      remember right, there's some ext out there using them...we must
      find it.
    * Rewired JITCompiler to use the new JIT.
    * Rewired InterpretedIRMethod to use JITCompiler.
    * Moved OneShotClassLoader out of ClassCache (in org.jruby.util)

    Before a native, in-process exec, shut down JMX agent.
    
    If the JRuby JVM is started with the remote JMX agent enabled,
    subsequence native exec of JRuby (basically restarting JRuby in
    the same process space) can fail because the port remains bound.
    This change uses internal OpenJDK classes to shut down the JMX
    agent before a native exec, so it can restart in the new JVM.
    
    A side effect of this is that if native exec fails, we must
    attempt to restart the agent as well. This will break connections
    for existing clients, but they would have lost connection had the
    exec succeeded. I don't see this as a problem.
    
    Fixes #1859.
