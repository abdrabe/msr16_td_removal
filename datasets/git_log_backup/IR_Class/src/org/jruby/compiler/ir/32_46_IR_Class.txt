    - More cleanup of scoping and removing old crud from when I didn't understand some of the scoping semantics properly; Added a metaclass object to encapsulate construction of the metaclass and keep some code clean.  All of this will need couple more passes and some more fixup.

    - Added some more code for frame load/store placement analyses +
      additional testing and bug fixes; requires more testing + bug fixing.

    - Cleaned up the scope setup some more; Integrated (not fully tested &
      debugged) closures into live variable anaysis code; Added instructions
      to allocate heap frame, load / store variables from frame (not
      integrated yet);

    - [ Hmm .. git newbie here .. somehow lost the commit .. trying again ] Fixed couple bugs with scope canonicalization; implemented ir output as a compiler pass; added code-version-token for IR_Method and added several method stubs to start optimizing calls

    - Cleaned up code to enable running compiler passes without having to write a lot of same boilerplate code all the time.  This will keep evolving and changing.  Just the first pass.

    - Moved all operands to operands/ and instructions to instructions/ and fixed up imports.  Added some commented out code to start running peephole opts on the IR -- which will also serve as a basis for SCCP passes later on.
