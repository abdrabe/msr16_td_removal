    Replace Visibility enum reference with a byte ordinal.
    
    This is for space-saving on the root class of all methods in the
    system.

    Move NativeCall stuff down to JavaMethod.
    
    Only methods down-hierarchy from JavaMethod ever actually have
    NativeCall so the extra size in all DynamicMethod subclasses is
    unnecessary.

    CallConfiguration is not used by any DynamicMethods anymore.
    
    CallConfiguration used to be needed to determine how to frame and
    scope all methods in the system. However, in JRuby 9k it is no
    longer needed.
    
    * Core methods that need frame/scope have the pre/post logic
      generated in bytecode (for generated invokers) or in handles
      (for MethodHandle-based invokers).
    * Interpreted IR methods have their own flags for frame/scope, or
      have instructions that perform the pre/post logic.
    * Jitted IR methods always have emit bytecode to do the pre/post
      logic.
    
    After a quick inspection I found that there's no other uses of
    the callConfig field in DynamicMethod, so this commit removes it
    and deprecates the constructors and accessors. This should shrink
    all DynamicMethod subclasses by at least 4 bytes and perhaps 8. It
    also reduces the size and overhead of our generated populators,
    which might have a slight effect on startup.

    StaticScope now has Signature instead of three individual fields.  All other
    changes were made to support this.  We encode/decode scopes with a full
    Signature.  Blocks are all rooted in providing a Signature.  All IR*Method
    will provide a Signature.  Unfortunately, I stopped at IR level for method
    types.  Over time those should get converted.
    
    This corrects all arity issues involving methods and blocks in interp.  JIT
    is still somewhere passing in the wrong values but I will correct that in
    a followup (this is not a regression).
    
    spec:fast:ruby and test:mri both pass so do JIT variants of those tests
    but I strong suspect we are shelling out in some way and running some of
    these tests in interp mode.
    
    On other note of distinction is that for builtin functions we only construct
    a subset of information that Signature wants because Arity is only a subset
    of the info Signature needs.  Since there are no exotic signatures in builtins
    there is a Signature.from(Arity) which will convert to a reasonable analogue
    or throw if it is special in some way.
    
    I tried to leave all deprecated versions of methods and constructors but
    I might have spaced out a few.
