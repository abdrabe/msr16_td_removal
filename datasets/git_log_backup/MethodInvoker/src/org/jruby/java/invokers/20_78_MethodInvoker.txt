    Move JavaCallable construction logic up into RubyToJavaInvoker using abstract creator/accessors in the method/constructor-related subclasses.

    Varargs support for method dispatch! Should fix JRUBY-195, but I don't like the impl much so far. Needs additional cleanup.

    Eliminate some and reduce other setAccessible calls for JRUBY-4246.
    
    * For all methods in all classes encountered by JRuby, we were doing setAccessible one at a time. This meant that even if the class was never directly used (and lazily initialized) we still called setAccessible for all methods. For classes that were directly used, we ended up doing a second round of setAccessible calls for each named group of methods. The latter remains, but is now the only setAccessible for methods and constructors.
    * All fields were being setAccessible. In the case of static public final fields, which we create constants for, this was obviously unnecessary. In the case of regular fields, we only ever retrieved the list of public fields, so it was again unnecessary. Also note that in both cases we did the setAccessible calls eagerly.

    Add java_method to peel out a specific overloaded Java method for later selection-free invocation. Only for instance methods atm.
