    - DynamicScope+children removed no longer used {get,set}ArgValues methods since they are dead.
    - ArgsNode getRest() replaced by hasRest() or retrieving getRestArgNode directly.
    - Slight rearrangement internally of fields in ArgsNode.
    - Remove accidental println from last commit.

    Revert "Generify scopes to Object, in preparation for using Object in"
    
    This reverts commit a57d94a4c02063e2df2c655fbe349d2b4769ba41.
    
    This change is right long term but breaks the current compiler in
    many unpleasant ways. Rather than sort them out, I'm reverting
    this for now. Once we switch to IR+JIT we should be able to
    reinstate this commit.
