    Fix more references to CPL.
    
    The phrase "Common Public License" was split across two lines in
    our default header, which caused it to be missed during earlier
    search/replace. Also, we did not replace the CPL URL in the
    header with the EPL URL.

    Switch JRuby's CPL license to EPL.
    
    Governance of the CPL license was moved to the Eclipse Foundation
    at some point in the past, and Eclipse blessed the EPL (Eclipse
    Public License v1.0) as the successor to CPL. Because the CPL
    contains a clause allowing transparent upgrades to future blessed
    successor licenses, we can make the move to EPL without
    re-contacting past contributors.
    
    The change in going from CPL to EPL largely just removes some
    punitive language that apparently made many companies nervous. All
    other language in the license remains identical.
    
    Several documents about Eclipse's move from CPL to EPL are here:
    
    http://www.eclipse.org/legal/cpl2epl/
    
    Note that Eclipse's move came before the blessing of EPL as the
    upgrade path for CPL, so they had to do a bit more legal juggling.
    With Eclipse now the administrator of CPL and with their blessing
    of EPL as the upgrade path for CPL, all we need to do is make the
    move.

    More JI cleanup:
     - Reworked the very expensive and thread-unsafe (and essentially obsolete) proxy extender mechanism. No longer is every new proxy checked against all proxy extenders; since the Rubification of the Java class hierarchy, it's really only necessary to extend the class/module specified in the extend_proxy method. I'd like to see this feature deprecated, as it's redundant now (see forthcoming note on jruby-dev).
     - Moved JavaClass instances to a ConcurrentHashMap for faster access.  They had been in a weak hash map, but since almost all of them were linked to proxies that were in non-weak maps, there was really no benefit (and some performance penalties).
     - Used concurrent techniques to speed proxy class lookup.  Proxies are now stored with their corresponding JavaClass instances, and can be retrieved with an unsynchronized access.
     - Eliminated the ProxyData "dataStruct" that had been attached to the JavaUtilities module; most of the fields (maps) had been eliminated in the work noted above; the remaining fields have been moved to JavaSupport where they may be accessed without a JavaUtilities reference.
     - Permanently disabled the the old-style (<) interface implementation syntax (there had been a method to enable it; no more).
     - Fixed a bug wherein the colon2 syntax for opening modules was not working if the module had not previously been referenced.  Will open a JIRA and backport to the 1.0 branch.
    
    Fixes JRUBY-931 (thread-unsafe proxy extender access).
    
    Most of this work is transitional; i.e., will probably be implemented differently when JI is overhauled.  Just cleaning up and clearing away dead wood in advance of that overhaul.
