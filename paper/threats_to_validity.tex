To understand the type of activities that lead to the introduce and remove of self-admitted technical debt, we conducted a online survey. We sent the survey to 188 developers who responsible for adding and removing self-admitted technical debt, and we received 14 (7.4\%) responses which may be considered small. However, a 7.4\% response rate is considered to be an acceptable response rate in questionnaire-based software engineering surveys~\cite{singer2008software}.

\noindent~\textbf{\textit{Construct Validity:}}
To identify the removed and added self-admitted technical debt, we consider commits as a single unit of change. However, a single commit may contains other source code changes. Moreover, we rely on Open-hub's data to merge developer identities, hence, our study is only as accurate as Open-hub's classification.

\noindent~\textbf{\textit{External Validity:}} The study is based on open source project that our finding could not be generalized to provide systems.
