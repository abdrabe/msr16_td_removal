%The notion of \SATD is based on the idea of admission, i.e., acknowledgement that a fact or statement is true\footnote{\url{http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/admission}}. In a way, this can be seen as a postponed promise to fix a bug or to implement functionality.

Our study shows that more of the self-removed technical debt is \emph{usually} removed than of the non-self-removed technical debt,
and that this usually happens faster for the self-removed technical debt.
These findings suggest that developers feel a certain responsibility not only for indicating technical debt but also for removing it.
This conclusion concurs with self-reported acute awareness of a software engineer when technical debt is being introduced~\cite{Wirfs-Brock}

\alexander{discuss practical implications of our findings}
Our findings have several implications for design of technical debt managing tools such as DebtFlag~\cite{Holvitie:Leppanen}.
DebtFlag visually indicates source code elements associated with the technical debt.
In order to support self-removal of technical debt, DebtFlag should personalise this visualisation and distinguish 
between technical debt elements introduced by the developer themselves as opposed to those introduced by other developers.
