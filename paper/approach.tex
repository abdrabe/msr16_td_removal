The main goal of our study is to understand what happens with \SATD comments after they are introduced in projects. To do that, we divided our study in two main parts. First, we use a manually classified dataset that contains \SATD comments from three open source projects. Then, we trace each \SATD finding when and by who the technical debt was introduced and removed. After that, we run our analysis and examine the results. Second, to scale our approach to more projects we implement a process that does not depends on a manually classified dataset. Using this approach we extracted \SATD comments from other five open source projects, and similarly we analyze the \SATD comments of these projects. Figure~\ref{fig:manually_classified_data_approach_overview} shows an overview of our manual approach, Figure~\ref{fig:automatically_classified_data_approach_overview} shows an overview of our automatic approach, and the following subsections detail each step.

\subsection*{Manually Classified Data Approach}
\label{sub:manually_classified_data_approach}

As shown in previous work, technical debt can be classified into different types ~\cite{Alves2014MTD}. However, design technical debt is the most common ~\cite{Maldonado2015MTD} and impactful ~\cite{Ernst2015FSE} type of debt. Therefore, to perform our study, we use manually classified \SATD comments from three different projects, namely Apache Ant, Apache Jmeter and Jruby. The analyzed dataset consists of 754 \SATD design comments distributed between the three projects. We choose to analyze Apache Ant, Apache Jmeter and Jruby as the version that contains the manually classified comments has enough past and future versions to be analyzed. Moreover, they have git repositories that are currently maintained enabling us to apply our approach. 

The manually classified comments are part of a bigger dataset of \SATD comments created during ours previous studies ~\cite{Maldonado2015MTD,Maldonado2015TSE}. Basically, during these previous works, we created a public available dataset containing 62,566 comments extracted from ten open source projects. These comments were classified as \SATD comments or as regular comments (i.e., comments without technical debt). The dataset was classified by the first author and later, to mitigate the risk of bias, another student was asked to classify a statistically significant sample of the dataset. The Cohen's kappa coefficient ~\cite{cohen1960coefficient} (i.e., the level of agreement between both reviewer) was of +0.81. The resulting coefficient is scaled to range between -1 and +1, where negative value means poorer than chance agreement, zero indicates exactly chance agreement, and positive value indicates better than chance agreement ~\cite{fleiss1973equivalence}.

\subsubsection*{Technical Debt Files Identification}
\label{subsub:technical_debt_files_identification}

We use the fully qualified name of the file (i.e., file path plus file name) to mine information from the source code repository, and the manually classified dataset contains the fully qualified name of each file that contains at least one \SATD design debt comment. However, the fully qualified name of the manually dataset does not correspond to the latest available version, and there is the possibility that the file has been moved around in future versions. The same problem could happen in past versions as well. Therefore, we need to identify the fully qualified name of each file on each future and past versions. 

In order to do that, we first extract the all versions of an project. Second, we incrementally try to match the fully qualified name in these versions. Every time that we have a match means that the file has not been moved. When we are not able to match the fully qualified name of the file we try to match just the file name. In the case that we have a single match using the file name we consider that the file has simply been moved to a different folder. In the case that we have more than one match using the file name we compare the similarity between the files (i.e., shortest added distance) and consider the most similar of the files as the file that has been moved. Lastly in the case that all these methods fails to find a match we consider that the file has been removed in the analyzed version.  

This process results in a mapping containing the fully qualified name for each version, and we store this information back in the database for future use.

\subsubsection*{Checkout All Versions of Technical Debt Files}
\label{subsub:checkout_all_versions_of_technical_debt_files}

Once that we identified the fully qualified name of the \SATD files we can extract from the source code repository all the different versions of these files. Having all versions of the \SATD files allow us to pinpoint the exact moment that the \SATD comment was introduced and if it was later removed.

First, we group the different fully qualified names that we obtained for each file. For example, if ``file1'' was in ``path1'' during 10 versions and then it was moved to ``path2''. The group of fully qualified names for ``file1'' would have two items: ``path1/file1'' and ``path2/file1''. 

Second, we identify the latest version (i.e., tag) that corresponding to each fully qualified name. This way we can checkout the repository to the desired version and extract all the changes (i.e., commits) done to the file considering the fully qualified name. This information is parsed and inserted into our database, providing us quick access to all commits that touched each \SATD file. 

Third, we use the commit list of each \SATD file to checkout all changed versions. This computation results in a collection of files that represents the full history of the \SATD file.  

\subsubsection*{Identify Author Who Introduced the Technical Debt}
\label{subsub:identify_author_who_introduced_the_technical_debt}

The next step is to identify the author who introduced the technical debt. In order to do so, we search for each \SATD comment that was manually classified in all different file versions that it belongs. We start by analyzing the oldest version of the \SATD file looking for a match. In the case that the match is negative we move to the next \SATD file version. We repeat this process until we find the exact match of the \SATD comment. 

We consider that we found the introduction of the \SATD comment when we have a exact match of the manual classified \SATD comment. In some cases the \SATD comment possess multiple lines, and it is possible to this comment to have partial matches (i.e., not all lines) across the files. However, we consider that the manual classified \SATD comment offers us the certainty that the comment is in fact a \SATD and should be considered in full while searching the version that it was introduced.

\subsubsection*{Identify Author Who Removed the Technical Debt}
\label{subsub:identify_author_who_removed_the_technical_debt}

To identify the author who removed the technical debt we start by analyzing the next file version that the \SATD comment was found. We incrementally check all future versions of the file until we can not find a match anymore. In the case that we are able to find the \SATD comment in all future versions means that the \SATD comment was not removed, and therefore has not a removed author to be identified. 

It is also possible that during the development of the project the \SATD file has been removed. As we have the mapping between the fully qualified name of the file and the version that it belongs we can also identify if they were removed. When we identify that the file was removed, we assume that the author responsible for the deletion is also the author who removed the \SATD comments that were in that file.
