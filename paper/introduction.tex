%overview technical debt
The term technical debt was first coined by Cunningham in 1993 to refer to the phenomena of taking a shortcut to achieve short term development gain at the cost of increased maintenance effort in the future \cite{Cunningham1992WPM}. The technical debt community has studied many aspects of technical debt, including its detection \cite{Zazworka2013EASE}, impact \cite{Zazworka2011MTD} and the appearance of technical debt in the form of code smells \cite{Fontana2012MTD}. 
Most recently, the notion of self-admitted technical debt (SATD) has been introduced by Potdar and Shihab~\cite{Potdar2014ICSME}: SATD refers to the situation when developers clearly indicate presence of
technical debt in the system implementation artifacts such as source code comments.
%researchers used source code comments to identify technical debt that referred to as
%\rabe{Everton} developed an approach to identify technical debt from code comments, referred to as self-admitted technical debt (SATD). 
SATD refers to the situation where developers know that the current implementation is not optimal and write comments alerting the inadequacy of the solution. 




%However, much technical debt remains in the projects. Why is studying removal important
Eventhough previous work argues that SATD has negative impact on software~\cite{Wehaibi2016SANER,kameiusingTDA2016}, it has also showed that some SATD remains in a project for long periods of time (up to 10 years\alexander{where does this data come from? isn't this an answer to RQ3?}) after its introduction. Therefore, an important question becomes ``why does some SATD remain for so long?'' and whether ``all SATD needs to be paid back?''. Examining the removal of SATD can shed light on potentially healthy patterns of debt, that may need not be paid back.

%What we do in this paper
Hence, in this paper we perform a mix-match empirical study using seven large open source software projects, where we examine phenomena relating to the removal of SATD. In particular, we examine the following questions:
\alexander{Why these questions? Motivaton!}
\begin{itemize}
	\item[\textbf{RQ}]\textbf{1:} How much self-admitted technical debt gets removed?
	\item[\textbf{RQ}]\textbf{2:} Who removes self-admitted technical debt? Is it most likely to be self-removed or removed by others?
	\item[\textbf{RQ}]\textbf{3:} How long does self-admitted technical debt survive in a project?
	\item[\textbf{RQ}]\textbf{4:} What activities lead to the removal of self-admitted technical debt?
\end{itemize}
To answer those questions, we first devise a technique to determine SATD introduction and removal. In total, we examine 5,733 instances of SATD removals.

%Our findings
\textbf{Paper contribution:} Our findings indicate that 
\begin{itemize}
	\item We find that the majority of \SATD comments gets removed over the evolution of the project. Considering all projects the percentage of \SATD comments removal ranges between 40.5 - 90.6\%, and on average 74.9\% of the identified \SATD is removed.
	\item We find that most \SATD (on average 54.4\% and median 61.0\%) is self-removed.
	\item We find that the median amount of time that self-removed technical debt stays in the project is 18 days whereas non self removal technical debt is 127 days. In addition we find that technical debt removals happens more when the files containing debt are edited than when they are removed.
\end{itemize}
