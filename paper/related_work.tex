In an earlier study Klinger et al. have conducted four interviews and observed that ``the individuals choosing to incur technical debt are usually different from those responsible for servicing the debt''~\cite{Klinger:etal}. 
This observation has been questioned by Spinola et al., who have found that while the online-survey respondents tended to agree with the observation,
the paper-survey respondents achieved high consensus in neither agreeing nor disagreeing with the observation~\cite{Spinola:etal}.
Therefore, to complement these studies we analyse the source code.
Indeed, if the observation of Klinger et al. holds for \SATD then we expect to see a clear separation between the individuals introducing \SATD and
individuals removing \SATD, resulting in a low \SATD self-removal.

Jian and Hassan have studied removal of comments in PostgreSQL from 1996 to 2005~\cite{Jiang:Hassan}. 
They have observed that at each 30-day period 0--40\% of functions with header comments have been removed; similar observation has been made for functions with non-header comments. 
Unfortunately, different focus of our studies (comments vs. functions, \SATD-comments vs. any comments) render our results incomparable.
